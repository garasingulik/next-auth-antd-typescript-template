# Next.js + NextAuth.js + AntD + TypeScript Template

This template is a homebrew template that I mainly use to bootstrap a new frontend project. It was based on official [Next.js with Ant Design Pro Layout Less](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-ant-design-pro-layout-less) template with additional things that I mostly use in my projects.

The template has been preconfigured with basic [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) credentials authentication using sqlite backend (not recommended for production), and ofcourse you can change this database backend with any database of your preference that is supported by NextAuth.js TypeORM Adapter.
